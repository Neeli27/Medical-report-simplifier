He gets sudden chest pain, a racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating. These episodes usually last 10-20 minutes and happen without warning, about once or twice a week. Michael is worried that he might be having a heart attack.\n","\n","**Medical Background**\n","\n","Michael has a history of anxiety, which he's been managing with therapy and occasional medication. He also has acid reflux, which is controlled with medication and diet changes. His family doesn't have a history of heart disease, but his mom has anxiety. Michael works a high-stress job, occasionally drinks caffeine and alcohol, and doesn't exercise regularly.\n","\n","**Test Results**\n","\n","The doctors did several tests to check Michael's heart and overall health. The good news is that:\n","\n","* His heart rhythm is normal.\n","* His heart is pumping blood properly.\n","* His blood tests showed no signs of heart damage or thyroid problems.\n","* A 24-hour heart monitor showed some irregular heartbeats, but they're not a concern.\n","* An ultrasound of his heart showed it's working normally.\n","\n","**Physical Exam**\n","\n","When the doctor examined Michael, they found:\n","\n","* His blood pressure and heart rate are normal.\n","* His heart sounds are normal, with no unusual noises.\n","* His lungs sound clear, with no signs of breathing problems.\n","\n","Overall, the tests didn't show any signs of a heart attack or serious heart condition. However, Michael's symptoms are still concerning, and his doctor will want to continue monitoring him to figure out what's causing these episodes.\n"]}]}]}
